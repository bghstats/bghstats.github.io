        <p>The Dashboard above has 3 pages, use the arrows at the bottom to navigate the report. Please note
            that this is subset of the Season 1 Guild league games. In total the guild played 224 matches, 34 matches
            in the 15-man format, and 190 matches in the 10-man format. The report above was generated using 150
            out of the 190 total matches since Pearl Abyss changed the format to 10 man. The missing 21% of matches were left
            out due to OCR application issues, should be able to fix this for season 2. Don't take any of the stat's
            to seriously, some classes will perform better in the format and gear is a large factor. Thank you to all
            the players who participated, this was a lot of fun, and we couldn't have participated without all of you <3
